# Insurance Risk Analytics & Predictive Modeling

## Project Overview
This project analyzes insurance data for AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS) to enhance their car insurance business in South Africa through advanced analytics. The goal is to identify low-risk customer segments for targeted premium reductions while maintaining profitability.

## Objectives
1. Understand insurance fundamentals and terminology
2. Conduct statistical analysis of risk factors across:
   - Geographic regions
   - Customer demographics 
   - Vehicle characteristics
3. Build predictive models for:
   - Claims prediction
   - Premium optimization
   - Risk assessment
