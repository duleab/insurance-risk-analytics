# Insurance Risk Analytics & Predictive Modeling

## Project Overview
This project analyzes insurance data for AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS) to enhance their car insurance business in South Africa through advanced analytics. The goal is to identify low-risk customer segments for targeted premium reductions while maintaining profitability.

## Key Results
- **Model Performance**: Random Forest model achieved 87% accuracy and 0.91 ROC AUC
- **Identified Low-Risk Segments**: Western Cape, Gauteng, Male drivers, Hatchback/Sedan vehicles, Toyota/Volkswagen makes
- **Premium Optimization**: 5-10% reduction for low-risk segments with projected 5-8% increase in retention rates
- **Business Impact**: Projected 2-3% increase in overall profitability

## Objectives
1. Understand insurance fundamentals and terminology
2. Conduct statistical analysis of risk factors across:
   - Geographic regions
   - Customer demographics 
   - Vehicle characteristics
3. Build predictive models for:
   - Claims prediction
   - Premium optimization
   - Risk assessment

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Initialize DVC: `dvc init`
4. Run the pipeline: `dvc repro`

## Data
The project uses historical insurance data from February 2014 to August 2015, including:
- Customer demographics
- Geographic information
- Vehicle details
- Premium and claims data

## Analysis Components
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Portfolio performance metrics
   - Risk factor analysis
   - Temporal and geographical patterns

2. **Statistical Testing**
   - Hypothesis testing for risk variations
   - Demographic risk profiling
   - Profitability analysis by segment

3. **Predictive Modeling**
   - Claims prediction models
   - Premium optimization framework
   - Risk scoring algorithms

## Model Performance

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | ROC AUC |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Random Forest | 87% | 84% | 79% | 0.81 | 0.91 |
| Logistic Regression | 85% | 82% | 75% | 0.78 | 0.88 |

## Business Recommendations

1. **Targeted Discount Program**: 5-10% premium reduction for low-risk segments
2. **Loyalty Rewards**: Increasing discounts for renewal years
3. **Safe Driver Program Enhancement**: Additional tiers for low-risk vehicles
4. **Dynamic Pricing Model**: Model-based pricing adjustments

## DVC Pipeline

The project uses Data Version Control (DVC) to manage the ML pipeline:

```
prepare → features → hypothesis_testing → train_model → generate_recommendations
```

Run `dvc dag` to visualize the pipeline structure.

## Future Work

- Implement automated CI/CD integration
- Develop model deployment pipeline
- Add data drift detection
- Configure cloud storage integration
- Enhance business impact metrics
